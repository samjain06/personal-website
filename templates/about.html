                                <p>I am from Celina, TX and I am a recent computer science graduate
                                    with a background in Unified Communications. I love developing solutions
                                    to automate manual tasks. I am excited to combine my academic background
                                    with my work as a Software Engineer to help companies automate their
                                    time-consuming tasks.</p>

                                <h3>My journey</h3>
                                <p>My journey started when I came across a chatbot on my parent’s computer
                                    in my childhood. It was fascinating to me how it can answer just like a
                                    person. Ever since then, I have got interested in computers. Later with
                                    this inspiration, I focused my effort towards studying computer science
                                    and on one of my previous job, I was able to develop a script which
                                    reduced about 60% of the time it took for me to do a user-based task.
                                    This was very well received by my company's clients.</p>

                                <p>In my recent project, I developed an application to provide class scheduler
                                    and roommate matching service for my university’s students. In this,
                                    my part was focused on creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitOps methodology. </p>

                                <h3>What I'm currently learning</h3>
                                <p>Currently, I am working on being proficient with Python framework Django
                                    and working on a project to enhance my understanding. I am also preparing
                                    for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Practitioner certification.</p>
